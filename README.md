## Getting Started

This project is an exercise / demonstration for the company Schibsted / Adevinta.

This solution consists of two projects maded in C #, one is the project itself and the other is the test project of the first.

In this exercise, it consists of a web application that shows the use and management of methodologies such as ASP.NET, mvc, web api, use of roles and responses to Http requests.

During the creation of this solution neither styles nor special layouts have been used since it was part of the established requirements.
